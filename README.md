# 🚀 University Data Science Society: Project Lab 2026

Welcome to the **Master Project Repository**! This repo serves as the central hub for our Data Science Project Lab. This is a living project designed for students to tinker, learn and see a full end-to-end data pipeline in action.

## 📋 Project Overview
We are building a comprehensive Data Science project that covers everything from raw data sourcing to machine learning deployment. Our goal is to provide a "Gold Standard" template that members can use as a blueprint for their own research.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
The project is organized into five core stages, reflecting our curriculum:

1.  **Data Sourcing:** Connecting to datasets via APIs or hosted CSVs.
2.  **Preliminary EDA:** Understanding data distributions and initial health checks.
3.  **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, feature engineering, and preparing data for models.
4.  **Advanced Visualisation:** Interactive storytelling using Plotly/PowerBI concepts.
5.  **Machine Learning:** Implementing baseline and advanced predictive models.

## 💻 How to Contribute
