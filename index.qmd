# 🚀 Welcome to the Project Lab

This repository serves as the central hub for our **Data Science Project Lab**. Designed for students to tinker, learn, and observe a full end-to-end data pipeline in action, this is a living project that evolves with our members.

Our goal is to provide a **"Gold Standard" template**—a blueprint that you can use for your own independent research and future professional portfolios.

## 🛠️ The Five Stages of Data Science

Our lab is organized into five core stages that mirror the professional data science lifecycle:

1.  ## 🛠️ The Five Stages of Data Science

Our lab is organized into five core stages that mirror the professional data science lifecycle. **Click a stage below to explore the technical notebooks:**

1. [**Data Sourcing**](1-Data-Sourcing/)  
   Connecting to datasets via APIs or hosted CSVs to build a reliable foundation.
2. [**Preliminary EDA**](2-Preliminary-EDA/)  
   Understanding data distributions and performing essential "health checks" on our raw information.
3. [**Data Wrangling**](3-Data-Wrangling/)  
   The "heavy lifting" of cleaning, feature engineering, and prepping data for high-performance models.
4. [**Advanced Visualisation**](4-Data-preprocessing/)  
   Interactive storytelling to turn dry numbers into compelling insights.
5. [**Machine Learning**](5-Predictive%20Modelling/)  
   Implementing everything from baseline statistics to advanced predictive models.

## 💻 Contributing to the "Gold Standard"

To maintain the quality of our master template, we follow a professional peer-review workflow. If you want to contribute:

* **Step 1:** Access our notebooks via the **Google Colab** links found in the technical pages.
* **Step 2:** Work on a separate **Branch**. Never save directly to `main`—this keeps our production code safe!
* **Step 3:** Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub. 
* **Step 4:** Join the review process. The Project Lead will review your logic before merging it into the master template.
