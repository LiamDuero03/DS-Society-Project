# 🚀 Welcome to the Project Lab

This repository serves as the central hub for our **Data Science Project Lab**. Designed for students to tinker, learn, and observe a full end-to-end data pipeline in action, this is a living project that evolves with our members.

Our goal is to provide a **"Gold Standard" template**—a blueprint that you can use for your own independent research and future professional portfolios.

## 🛠️ The Five Stages of Data Science

Our lab is organized into five core stages that mirror the professional data science lifecycle. **Click a stage below to view the technical notebooks:**

1. [**Data Sourcing**](1-Data-Sourcing/Data-Sourcing.ipynb)  
   Connecting to datasets via APIs or hosted CSVs to build a reliable foundation.
2. [**Preliminary EDA**](2-Preliminary-EDA/Preliminary-EDA.ipynb)  
   Understanding data distributions and performing essential "health checks" on our raw information.
3. [**Data Wrangling**](3-Data-Wrangling/Data-Wrangling.ipynb)  
   The "heavy lifting" of cleaning, feature engineering, and prepping data for high-performance models.
4. [**Advanced Visualisation**](4-Data-preprocessing/Data-Preprocessing.ipynb)  
   Interactive storytelling to turn dry numbers into compelling insights.
5. [**Predictive Modelling**](5-Predictive%20Modelling/Predictive_modelling.ipynb)  
   Implementing everything from baseline statistics to advanced predictive models.

## 💻 Contributing to the "Gold Standard"

To maintain the quality of our master template, we follow a professional peer-review workflow. If you want to contribute:

* **Step 1: Access the Code** Browse the technical pages using the links above. Each notebook includes a link to open it directly in **Google Colab**.
* **Step 2: Work on a Branch** When saving your work back to GitHub, select **"Create new branch"**. Never save directly to `main`—this keeps our production website stable!
* **Step 3: Submit a PR** Create a **Pull Request** on GitHub. This allows the Project Lead to review your logic.
* **Step 4: Review & Merge** Once approved, your changes will be merged into the master template and will appear on this website automatically.
